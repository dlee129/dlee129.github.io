## Welcome to my Website!
Here is a sample of my work [Color Game](https://github.com/dlee129/ColorGame) that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to be a game in which the user has to guess the shade of the color based on the given rbg attributes.

### About Me 

My name is David Lee and I am a graduate from Queens College with my Bachelor's in Computer Science! Throughout my 4 years of studying Computer Science at Queens College, I have taken many different types of courses and have come to enjoy Computer Science as a whole. I am always looking to learn new technologies and evolve as a programmer.

### Projects

There are a couple of projects that I have completed and are avaiable to be viewed through my [github profile](https://github.com/dlee129).

Some of the more notable projects include: 

[HuffMan Coding](https://github.com/dlee129/DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithms/tree/master/HuffmanCoding), which is an algorithm created based on binary code ordered in a binary tree. 

[Linked List Insertion](https://github.com/dlee129/DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithms/tree/master/LinkedListInsertionSort), which is a very popular algorithm sorting method that inserts nodes with values into a linked list in an ascending order of value.

[JUnit](https://github.com/dlee129/Software-Engineering/tree/master/JUnit), which is a Java framework that allows users to create and execute test cases for code to check for all cases for whitebox and blackbox testing.
